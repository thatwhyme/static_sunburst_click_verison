All the following bugs for static versioin has done.

the bugs mentioned in emails:
1 、
All the static game versions you have sent me have a serious bug. When
you try to move the red to a number which is smaller than it,
something weird happens. It takes too long. Lets meet and talk about
what you have done there, because I'm sure we can fix this bug. It
should be as quick as the dynamic version.
This problem appears both in the click and the drag version of the static game.

2、
actually may be you can fix it easily: it seems that when you drop to
a smaller number, the colors are not updated until you move the mouse.
So if you move to smaller label, the program waits for a movement of
the mouse before it updates the colors and labels.

Can you look at that? They should be updated immediately after the
drop, just like it happens when you move to a larger label.

the only static version that does not have this problem is the one
with the Red list, where you set the red in advance.

I don't know why.

3、

I found a bug about the dummy area. Have a look at the screenshot.

This is a tree of length 6. So, counting two levels at once, there are
three levels where gray areas can start from: level 2, level 4 and
level 6. But here they started from both level 3 and 4. So the one
that starts at level 3, which appears at the top, it is the larger
one, is wrong. It shouldn't appear. Because it corresponds to a
subtree of length 4 that starts from level 1, which is an odd level,
but we only care about the even levels.

Do you know what I mean? The 3/4 rule only applies to four children
that are on even levels (so their father is also on even level). The
others don't count.

4、
in the static version with the click (you recently sent me that, no
drag) there is a big bug. Basically after I choose the red, and I play
my first blue move, it forgets all the remaining red....

Can you please fix?
